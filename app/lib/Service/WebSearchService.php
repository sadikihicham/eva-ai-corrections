 * party, so it is *off by default*, admin-only, and never triggered
 * automatically - the chat model has to explicitly call the `web_search`
 * tool (see ToolPolicy and ActionExecutor).
 *
 * Providers are abstracted behind one normalized result shape so the rest of
 * the app never talks to a vendor API directly:
 *
 *  - `searxng`: a self-hosted SearxNG instance (no third party at all, the
 *    recommended option for privacy-conscious instances).
 *  - `brave`:  Brave Search API (hosted, requires an API key).
 *  - `tavily`: Tavily Search API (hosted, tuned for LLM grounding).
